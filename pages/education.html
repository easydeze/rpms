            <h1>Educational Activities</h1>
            <span class = "separated"></span>
            <p>Activities are coordinated periodically throughout the school year for undergraduates to learn about and explore different aspects of a career in medicine. These unique educational opportunities include lectures, discussion panels, and hands-on experiences with physicians and medical students. Topics we plan on introducing include: A Day in the Life of a Physician, Women in Medicine, LGBTQ+ in Medicine, Burnout in the Pathway to Medicine, Texas Medical Schools, MCAT Preparation, and more. We also run accessibility programs such as an MCAT book drive with local medical schools and a Pre-Med Advice Guide.</p>
            <br/>
            <p style = "font-size: larger;">Fall Events (all virtual):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>A Day in the Life of a Physician Panel (September):</u> Physicians of various specialties will present a typical workday in their respective workplaces and share how they manage a work-life balance. Students will learn about the benefits and sacrifices of a career in medicine.                </li>
                <li><u>Women in Medicine Panel (October):</u> Female physicians of various specialties will share their experiences in the medical field. They will discuss gender-related challenges they have faced and will advise students on maintaining a work-life balance. Students can compare information between different specialties to gain a more accurate perspective about gender dynamics and time management.</li>
                <li><u>LGBTQ+ in Medicine Panel (November):</u> Physicians of different sexual orientations will share their experiences of being part of the LGBTQ+ community while also practicing medicine. They will discuss health issues that specifically affect the LGBTQ+ community and how they create an LGBTQ-friendly practice. Rice pre-med students attending this panel can gain awareness of how to become better allies for LGBTQ+ patients throughout their future medical education/career.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <p style = "font-size: larger;">Spring Events:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Burnout in the Pathway to Medicine Panel:</u> We plan to explore mental health among members of the medical community by inviting Rice pre-med undergraduates, medical school students, and physicians to share their experiences with burnout. We hope to create a comforting atmosphere where Rice pre-med students can understand that burnout is a shared experience on the pathway to medicine, as well as feel more supported in addressing burnout throughout their future medical endeavors. </li>
                <li><u>Texas Medical School Panel:</u> We will invite Rice alumni from various Texas medical schools to speak on the culture of their respective medical schools and share their medical school experiences with interested Rice pre-medical students. TMDSAS applicants can take this panel as an opportunity to gain insight from current Texas medical students before ranking of school preference is due.</li>
                <li><u>MCAT + The Path to Medical School Panel:</u> Panelists will share their MCAT experiences, explain how they studied, and provide tips. Panelists will also discuss the path they took or are taking to medical school, highlighting experiences that helped make them a strong applicant and future professional. Students will be advised on topics such as writing.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
