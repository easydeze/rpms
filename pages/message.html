            <h3>Dear Rice University Alumni Physicians,</h3>
            <p>The Rice Pre-Medical Society (RPMS) is an active student organization dedicated to supporting Rice’s large pre-medical student population on their path to medical school and successful careers in medicine. However, many of our programs and resources depend upon the expertise and involvement of Rice alumni physicians like you! Below, you will find brief descriptions of several RPMS programs seeking volunteers. The circumstances surrounding COVID-19 only make your experience and enthusiasm more valuable! Our programming will be conducted remotely and in-person, so we welcome volunteers from both inside and outside of Houston! We are excited to use our events and opportunities to provide a broad range of perspectives and experiences from around America! We would love to hear from you if you are available and interested in participating in any of the below programs for the upcoming academic year. See the survey link below.</p>
            <p><u>Big Owls/Little Owls Program (BOP):</u> A mentorship program that connects a small group of Rice undergraduates with medical students and physicians. Meetings are held monthly in a casual setting, promoting discussion of medical issues and topics outside of academics, such as lifestyle, aspirations, and what it is actually like to be a medical student or physician. </p>
            <p><u>Educational Activities:</u> Activities are coordinated periodically throughout the school year for undergraduates to learn about and explore different aspects of a career in medicine. These unique educational opportunities include lectures, discussion panels, and hands-on experiences with physicians and medical students. Topics we plan on introducing include The Path to Medical School, A Day in the Life of a Physician, Women in Medicine, Dual Degree Panel, Healthcare Disparities, LGBTQ+, and more.</p>
            <p><u>2022 Medical Speaker Conference:</u> This year’s Medical Speaker Conference will be held on Saturday, February 12th, 2022 with the theme of Medical Ethics and Health Policy. Ethics and policy in medicine have been long standing topics of discussion, especially as new technologies develop and health disparities persist. Through this conference, we aim to examine how different areas of study within medical ethics intersect to influence health policy. A few subtopics of highlight at the conference include neuroethics, transplant ethics, health disparities, and medical decision making. </p>
            <p><u>Mock Medical School Interviews:</u> In coordination with the Rice Office of Academic Advising, we organize mock medical school interviews with students in the medical school application cycle. As interviews are a critical step in the medical school application process, alumni physicians will conduct mock interviews for Rice applicants to provide useful feedback on their performance and help them become comfortable with the interviewing process. We will be hosting both traditional Mock Interviews as well as CASPer/MMI Situational Judgement Test Interviews.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in helping to support any program, please take a few minutes to fill out the survey below for us to gather your contact information and put you in touch with the appropriate RPMS officer. </p>
