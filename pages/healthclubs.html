                <p>We aim to empower our patients through intelligent patient discharge. Recent research has shown that a well-executed patient discharge plan by nurses or pharmacy technicians have increased medication compliance and decreased re-hospitalizations. We believe that resourceful and persistent college students will be just as effective, without the extra cost. Our plan is to shape the program to become an important part of patient care at the Ben Taub Emergency Center.</p>
