            <h1>Individual and On-Campus Opportunities</h1>
            <p>Having a passion for working with and serving your community is an integral and fulfilling part of becoming involved in a medical profession. Rice is located next to the world-renowned Texas Medical Center, where there are numerous volunteering opportunities in its hospitals! Please see the General Hospital Volunteering Sheet for information on volunteering in these hospitals; please note that these hospital opportunities are intended for students who want to make a longer commitment to one outreach project.</p>
            <p>Here, you can also find non-hospital volunteering opportunities and a sheet updated with on-campus volunteering opportunities for pre-medical students at Rice. For the 2022 spring semester, we are promoting remote activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic; these are also listed below. If you have any questions, please contact Ananya Srivastava at as245@rice.edu and Charles Lee at cgl5@rice.edu.</p>
